     <div class="panel-body">Vehicles will be hand washed using microfiber wash mitts, two bucket method, foamed with soap containing
       carnauba wax to provide added shine and protection to the paint, and rinsed thoroughly. The use of spray sealant to assist the
        drying process is necessary to provide optimum lubrication between the paint and the microfiber towel to eliminate the chance
         of installing swirls into the paint, while leaving behind a layer of carnauba wax that will leave your paint glowing until the
          next wash.

     <div class="panel-body">In order to improve the appearance of your vehicle's paint and add protection from UV rays, scratching,
      and water spots. Your vehicle can be treated with any combination of sealants, glazes, and or waxes. Glazes provide beautiful
      depth and shine of your vehicle's paint that can not be replicated by wax, or sealant, but only provide protections to your
      vehicle's paint for 2-4 weeks. Sealants can protect your paint and leave it shining anywhere from 6-12 months depending on
      sun exposure and how often the vehicle is washed while leaving an improved gloss finish. Wax can provide 2-4 months worth of
      protection to your vehicle's paint while increasing the paints appearance further than a sealants, but less than a glazes.</div>
