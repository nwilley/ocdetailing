<h2>What We Offer</h2>
</div>

<div class = "well">
  <ul>
    <li id = "ext">Wash:</li>
    <p>Vehicles will be hand washed using microfiber wash mitts, two bucket method, foamed with soap containing carnauba wax to provide added shine and protection to the paint, and rinsed thoroughly   </p>
    <li id = "ext">Clay Bar:</li>
    <p>After the vehicle has been washed, it may be necessary to clay the vehicle in order to remove road tar, brake dust, industrial fallout, and other contaminates that a typical wash is not capable of removing. Even though these contaminates may not be visible to the naked eye, they can drastically change the paints finish when properly removed. </p>
    <li id = "ext">Dry Vehicle With Spray Wax:</li>
    <p>The use of spray wax to assist the drying process is necessary to provide optimum lubrication between the paint and the microfiber towel to eliminate the chance of installing swirls into the paint, while leaving behind a layer of carnauba wax that will leave your paint glowing until the next wash.  </p>
    <li id = "ext">Engine Bay Detail:</li>
    <p>High pressure steam is harnessed to remove dirt, oil, and other contaminates from your vehicle's engine bay. This will be followed by the use of a long lasting, durable dressing to leave your engine bay looking like it did when the car arrived at the dealership.</p>
    <li id = "ext">Polish Chrome:</li>
    <p>In order to remove water spots and contaminates from your vehicle's chrome surface, the chrome will be hand polished with a microfiber towel to produce an improved finish.</p>
    <li id = "ext">Restore Trim:</li>
    <p>Over time, your vehicle's trim will dry out and dull due to UV rays from the sun. It is important to rejuvenate the surfaces to restore the shine they once had, or maintain the existing appearance. </p>
    <li id = "ext">Restore Headlights:</li>
    <p>Just like your vehicle's trim, your headlights will oxidize over time due to UV rays from the sun. In order to remove oxidation, your vehicle's headlights will be polished until the dead plastic is permanently removed. The removal of this dead plastic will greatly improve visibility and appearance of the headlight. To protect the headlight from oxidizing, it will be coated in a durable sealant</p>
    <li id = "ext">Paint Correction:</li>
    <p>In order to remove permanent imperfections from your vehicle's paint such as swirls, scratches, oxidation, and water spots that can permanently etch themselves into your paint, your paint will be polished with a dual action orbital buffer. The removal of these imperfections will allow light rays to reflect from your vehicle's paint with reduced distortion, providing crystal clear reflections. </p>
    <li id = "ext">Touch Up Paint:</li>
    <p>Touch up paint will be applied to rock chips, scratches, and gouges in the vehicle's paint through the use of paint matched touch up paint, clear coat, assorted brushes for application, and will be blended into the vehicle's existing paint through the use of a dual action polisher. While a repair to this extent can greatly reduce the visibility of imperfections in your vehicle's paint and prevent rust/additional peeling of clear coat/basecoat, these repairs can not replicate the results of a new paint job. </p>
    <li id = "ext">Apply Glazes/Sealants/Waxes:</li>
    <p>In order to improve the appearance of your vehicle's paint and add protection from UV rays, scratching, and water spots. Your vehicle can be treated with any combination of sealants, glazes, and or waxes. Glazes provide beautiful depth and shine of your vehicle's paint that can not be replicated by wax, or sealant, but only provide protections to your vehicle's paint for 2-4 weeks. Sealants can protect your paint and leave it shining anywhere from 6-12 months depending on sun exposure and how often the vehicle is washed while leaving an improved gloss finish. Wax can provide 2-4 months worth of protection to your vehicle's paint while increasing the paints appearance further than a sealants, but less than a glazes.  </p>
    <li id = "ext">Undercarriage:</li>
    <p>Leaving dirt/salt/road debris on your vehicle's undercarriage can result in expedited formation of rust. Cleaning the undercarriage will prevent rusting and leave your car looking new. </p>
